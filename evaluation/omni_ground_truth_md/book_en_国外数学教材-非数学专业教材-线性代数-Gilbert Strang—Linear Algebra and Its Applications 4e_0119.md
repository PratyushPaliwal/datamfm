You must notice that the word “dimensional” is used in two different ways. We speak
about a four-dimensional *vector*, meaning a vector in $\mathbf{R}^4$. Now we have defined a four-dimensional *subspace*; an example is the set of vectors in $\mathbf{R}^6$ whose first and last components are zero. The members of this four-dimensional subspace are six-dimensional
vectors like $(0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 0)$.

One final note about the language of linear algebra.We never use the terms“basis of a matrix” or “rank of a space” or “dimension of a basis.” These phrases have no meaning. It is the dimension of the column space that equals the rank of the matrix, as we prove in the coming section.

# Problem Set 2.3

# Problems 1-10 are about linear independence and linear dependence.

1. Show that $v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}$ are independent but $v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}, v_{4}$ are dependent:

$$
$$
v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \qquad v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \qquad v_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \qquad v_4 = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
$$

Solve $c_1v_1 + \cdots + c_4v_4 = 0$ or $Ac=0$. The $v$'s go in the columns of $A$.

2. Find the largest possible number of independent vectors among

$$
$$
v_{1}=\left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] \quad v_{2}=\left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] \quad v_{3}=\left[\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{array}\right] \quad v_{4}=\left[\begin{array}{r} 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] \quad v_{5}=\left[\begin{array}{r} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{array}\right] \quad v_{6}=\left[\begin{array}{r} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{array}\right]
$$
$$

This number is the ____ of the space spanned by the $v$ 's.

3.Prove that if $a = 0 , d = 0$ or $f = 0$ (3 cases), the columns of $U$ are dependent:

$$
$$
U = \left[ { \begin{array} { l l l } { a } & { b } & { c } \\ { 0 } & { d } & { e } \\ { 0 } & { 0 } & { f } \end{array} } \right] .
$$
$$

4.If $a , d , f$ in Problem 3 are all nonzero, show that the only solution to $Ux = 0$. is $x = 0$ Then $U$ has independent columns.

5.Decide the dependence or independence of

(a) the vectors $(1,3,2), (2,1,3)$, and $(3.2,1)$.
(b) the vectors $(1, -3, 2), (2, 1, -3)$, and $(-3, 2, 1)$.
